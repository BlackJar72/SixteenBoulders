The idea for multiplayer: Competition to knock your balls out first.

Each of two players (or possibly also two of two) choose to be either 
the white team or the black team.  Half the ball are black and half 
are white; each team tries knock there own balls (color match) out 
white avoiding knocking the other teams balls out.  They may also 
try to prevent their apponent from knocking out balls.  First to 
knock out all balls of their own color wins the game.

Due to the probable shortness of individual games players would play 
multi-game matches, similar to tennis.  After a number of connected 
games (probably 5, 6, or 7) a player who is two games ahead wins; 
if neither is sufficiently ahead of the other play continues until 
one player is ahead by two games.  The first to be ahead by two 
games at or after wins.  Since this is likely to typically be 
played casually the two-ahead rule may be a toggleable and a single 
game mode may also exist.

Some rules and setup would differ for multiplayer.  Rather than spawning
in the center of the arena each player would spawn on opposite sides facing 
each other.  A player avatar of some kind would be needed, allowing players 
to see each other.  The balls would not be scattered randomly as in the 
single player, but would be placed in a circle, a fixed distance from the 
center and 8/pi radian appart and alternating between the two colors; this 
is to avoid one player of the other having an advantage due purely to 
luck.  Falling into the void would not be game over, but respawn after 
five seconds so that pushing an apponent into the void will not be a way 
to cheese a victory; instead it would remain a valid tactic for agressive 
players with the consequences to the player knock off being small -- a 
few seconds rather than an instant loss.

(The idea of a multiplayer play ground for children and non-compatetive players 
could also exist, though I don't think it would be any good.)
